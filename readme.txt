Redirect users to different locations after logging in and logging out.

== Description ==

If you've ever signed into an eCommerce or membership website, you've probably noticed that you're redirected to another specific webpage after signing in. This is due to some webmasters preferring to redirect the users once they log in.

Users are automatically redirected to the admin dashboard when logged into a WordPress website. However, there are several instances in which custom redirects once a user signs in.  Of course, it is dependent on the specific user, his user role, or some other aspect of your site.

= Benefits of User Role Redirect Plugin =
* Set a range of redirect rules for certain users, roles, and capabilities, and also general rules for all the other users. 
* Set a post-registration redirect URL too. All of this is managed under Settings > User Role Redirect.
* If required, you can insert your code logic before and after any of the plugin's standard redirect checks. 
* Redirecting users to a particular page on initial login and redirecting people depending on their IP address are a few examples.

* It only permits a limited number of authorized people to make changes to your existing content.
